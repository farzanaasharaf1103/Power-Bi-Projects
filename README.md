# Pizza Store Sales Analytics
An end-to-end Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard that delivers deep insights into sales performance, revenue trends, customer behavior, and product profitability.

📅 What are the daily and monthly sales trends?

🍕 How do pizza categories (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, Chicken) and sizes (Large, Medium, Small, Regular, etc.) impact sales?

⏳ What are the busiest days and peak months for orders?
